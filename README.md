# Data_Hackathon

# We use python to do data Curation and leverage sklearn to predict the diseases

Tasks
Part A
Develop a model to predict whether an individual will have a stroke in 2018 or not. Please refer to the Data tab above for more information on the dataset. We recommend using multiple data points.

Hint:

Think about what factors may influence the possibility of a stroke (beyond the straightforward (smoker status). Things like; age, gender, marital status, residency, etc should all be considered)
We also recommend using visualisation to gather insights that you can include in your report as graphical aids.
The scores from Part A will determine your leaderboard ranking.

Part B
Determine which treatment, or combination of treatments are the most effective in helping to prevent stroke for those with a heart condition. To progress to the presentation round, your code and report (part C) must address this section.

Part C
You must create a 1-2 page report summarising your methodology, findings and recommendations. This will be helpful if your team makes it to the final round of presentations (top 10) as determined by Part A.
You can find more information about variables in the Data Dictionary file located in the Data tab above.

Submissions
Please note that each team is restricted to a maximum of just 20 submissions. We highly recommend you use these wisely and spend a significant amount of time on in-depth data analysis.

The top 10 teams will now be selected based on Kaggle Rank, Code Audit and Report.

All members of presenting teams must attend the presentations.

Important Ranking Information
Please note that the leaderboard is calculated with approximately 60% of the test data. The final results will be based on the other 40%, so the FINAL STANDINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT.
